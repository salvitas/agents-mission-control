**Conceptualised & designed by Malaka Jayawardene.**

**Important:** This is a highly user-specific Home Assistant dashboard.  
The YAML in this repository will **not** function out-of-the-box on other systems due to unique helpers, sensors, custom logic, and tailored UI behaviour.

Instead, **use this repo as a guide** to learn and adopt:
- Styling techniques  
- Advanced card constructions  
- Animation & transitions  
- Browser_mod pop-up flows  
- Glassmorphism design  
- Room summary logic  
- Presence mapping  
- Quickfire controls  
- Weather, media, and automation UI patterns  

This repository is best viewed as a **concept library** that demonstrates how the Abode dashboard was built so you can replicate the _patterns_, not the exact implementation.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start — How to Use This Repo

Before diving in, please note that this dashboard is **not** intended to be copied and pasted directly into your Home Assistant setup.  
Nearly every card depends on custom helpers, scripts, sensors, booleans, and UI assets that are **unique** to this installation.

Instead:

---

### **1. Browse the folder structure**

Each folder contains a self-contained part of the UI:

- **Weather Dashboard** — animated icons, sunrise/sunset arc, forecasts
- **Energy Card** - based on Hildebrand integration
- **Media Station** — speaker groups, requests, transfers 
- **Room Cards** — glassmorphic room tiles with presence, lights, climate, blinds
- **Location Card** - Based on a sleek combination of iOS shortcuts and webhooks (will post a separate guide on this in due course as currently only YAML behind the card is included)
- **Surveillance** — live camera streams & motion states
- **Housekeepers Card** — robot vacuums & mower control    
- **Quickfire Controls** — lights, climate, blinds, automations
- **Scripts & Helpers** — logic powering UI behaviour (will be updating this in due course)

Use these as references to understand layout, structure, and design patterns.

---

### **2. Identify ideas you want to borrow**

This repo contains many techniques that are hard to find elsewhere, including:

- Dynamic background effects (gradient fills, presence states, battery/progress bars)  
- Animated icon systems  
- Multi-stage browser_mod pop-ups  
- State-based UI morphing  
- Smooth transitions between collapsed/expanded card modes  
- Layered visibility animations within a single card  
- Full-page modal takeovers  
- RTSP camera cropping + grid layouts  

Pick the concepts you like and adapt them to your own entities.

---

### **3. Replace entities with your own**

Every YAML section uses entities such as:

```
binary_sensor.<custom_presence>
climate.<zone_heating>
cover.<somfy_blinds>
camera.<eufy_custom>
sensor.house_temperature_weighted
input_boolean.<dashboard_flags>
script.<custom_logic>
```

These **must** be replaced with your own Home Assistant entities.

---

### **4. Install required custom components**

Most UI elements rely on:

- **button-card**  v4.3.0
- **browser_mod**  v2.6.1
- **layout-card**  v2.4.6
- **stack-in-card**  v0.2.0
- **card-mod**  v3.4.5
- **slider-entity-row**  v17.4.1
- **state-switch**  v1.9.6
- **bubble card**  v3.0.4
- **mini-graph-card**  v0.13.0
- **thermostat-card** (HA native)  

Make sure these are installed before attempting to use any examples.

---

### **5. Review scripts & helpers**

Many UI elements depend on:

- Light snapshots  
- Automation snapshots  
- PIN-protected automation kill gate  
- Blinds control helper scripts  
- ETA & presence processing  
- Media control scripts  

You’ll need equivalents adapted to your setup. The separate scripts section will soon be added.

<h1 style="color:#8AB4F8; font-weight:700;">CLOCK & WEATHER CARD</h1>

<img width="546" height="409" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f47f4701-2a35-4325-925f-70505247392d" />


**Purpose**

Glassmorphic header block for the Home dashboard that:

- Hides the HA top bar when kiosk mode is enabled (via a `kiosk-mode="on"` attribute on the view).
- Shows a live front door camera when the doorbell view is active.
- Otherwise shows:
  - A “Welcome Abode” title.
  - A large animated weather + time header (condition, temperature, current time, date).
  - A dynamic sun arc / lunar phase visual using `sun.sun` and `sensor.moon_phase`.
  - A compact 5-day forecast bar card with min/max temps, precipitation probability, and animated SVG icons.
  - A 12-hour temperature line chart with glowing gradient and animated path.

---

**Required custom cards / plugins**

Install via HACS (or equivalent):

- `custom:mod-card` (and `card-mod` for styling)
- `custom:layout-card`
- `custom:button-card`
- `custom:stack-in-card`

---

**Required entities**

- Doorbell toggle and camera  
  - `input_boolean.doorbell_camera_active` – turns the doorbell live view on/off.  
  - `camera.front_door_bell_live_view` – your front doorbell / camera entity.

- Time + sun + moon  
  - `sensor.time` – standard HA time sensor (Time & Date integration).  
  - `sun.sun` – core Sun integration.  
  - `sensor.moon_phase` – moon phase sensor (e.g. Moon integration).

- Weather  
  - `weather.forecast_abode` – main weather entity used for current condition + temperature.  
  - `sensor.tomorrow_raw_hourly` – raw hourly forecast sensor from Tomorrow.io (must expose
    `attributes.timelines.hourly` with `time` and `values.temperature`, `values.weatherCode`,
    `values.precipitationProbability`).

---

**Required assets**

- Animated SVG weather icons in `/config/www` (exposed as `/local/...`) - Provided in the repo

  - Line icons for the big header:
    - `/local/weather-icons/weather-icons-master/design/line/animation-ready/<icon>.svg`
  - Fill icons for the 5-day forecast:
    - `/local/weather-icons/weather-icons-master/design/fill/animation-ready/<icon>.svg`

  _You can use any icon set as long as you update the paths in the JavaScript blocks as appropriate to your setup._

- 🧠 Backend Setup (Required)

  - The clock-weather card uses a few *template sensors* and one *REST sensor* for Tomorrow.io.
  - Add these to `configuration.yaml` (or your preferred split YAML files).

    - Template Sensors (Sun, Moon, Weather) - The three moon template sensors are required for the clock-weather card’s night-time moon animation.
      ```yaml
      template: 
        - sensor:
            - name: "Weather Abode Temperature"
              state: "{{ state_attr('weather.forecast_abode', 'temperature') }}"
              unit_of_measurement: "°C"
      
            - name: "Weather Abode Condition"
              state: "{{ states('weather.forecast_abode') }}"
      
            - name: "Moonrise Time"
              state: >
                {% set lat = state_attr('zone.home','latitude') %}
                {% set lon = state_attr('zone.home','longitude') %}
                {% set times = integration('astral').get_moon_times(now().date(), lat, lon) %}
                {{ times['rise'].astimezone(now().tzinfo) if 'rise' in times else 'unknown' }}
      
            - name: "Moonset Time"
              state: >
                {% set lat = state_attr('zone.home','latitude') %}
                {% set lon = state_attr('zone.home','longitude') %}
                {% set times = integration('astral').get_moon_times(now().date(), lat, lon) %}
                {{ times['set'].astimezone(now().tzinfo) if 'set' in times else 'unknown' }}
      
            - name: "Moon is Up"
              state: >
                {% set rise = states('sensor.moonrise_time') %}
                {% set set = states('sensor.moonset_time') %}
                {% set n = now().strftime('%H:%M') %}
                {{ (rise != 'unknown' and set != 'unknown') and (rise < n < set) }}
      ```
    - Tomorrow.io REST Sensor (Hourly Forecast)
      ```yaml
      rest:
        - resource: https://api.tomorrow.io/v4/weather/forecast?location=52.2677,0.3560&timesteps=1h&units=metric&apikey=!secret tomorrow_api_key #(register at tomorrow.io to obtain the API Key)
          scan_interval: 1800
          sensor:
            - name: "Tomorrow Raw Hourly"
              value_template: "OK"
              json_attributes:
                - timelines
      ```
---

**Kiosk mode behaviour**

The top-level `mod-card` includes CSS:

- Hides `app-header` and `app-toolbar` when the active `hui-view` has `kiosk-mode="on"`.

To use this:

- Either add `kiosk-mode="on"` to your view via a custom theme or custom panel, or  
- Remove that CSS block if you don’t need kiosk mode.

---

**How to adapt for your setup**

- Replace the following entities with your own:
  - `input_boolean.doorbell_camera_active` → your boolean controlling when to show the doorbell.
  - `camera.front_door_bell_live_view` → your door camera entity.
  - `weather.forecast_abode` → your main weather entity.
  - `sensor.tomorrow_raw_hourly` → your hourly forecast sensor (structure must match Tomorrow.io style).
  - `sensor.moon_phase` → your moon phase sensor (or adjust the code to remove lunar phase if not used).
- Ensure `sensor.time` and `sun.sun` are available (core integrations).
- Update icon file paths if your `/local` weather icons live in a different folder or if you use another icon pack.
- If you don’t want the header text “Welcome Abode 🙏”, change the markdown card content to whatever title you prefer.
- If you’re not using kiosk mode, you can safely remove the `/* Hide top bar when kiosk-mode is ON */` CSS section from the `style` block at the top.

---

**Notes**

- The 5-day forecast bars compute per-day min/max temperature and precipitation probability by aggregating the raw hourly timeline (no template sensors needed).
- The rain bar uses a glassmorphic gradient with a small 💧 icon and percentage label, and animates in a short time after page load.
- The 12-hour chart is an inline SVG rendered inside a `custom:button-card` using the first 12 entries of `sensor.tomorrow_raw_hourly.attributes.timelines.hourly`.

<h1 style="color:#8AB4F8; font-weight:700;">ENERGY CARD</h1>

<img width="560" height="169" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3013eb69-1f4d-4fda-a3ac-5c3855336338" />

**Purpose**

A glassmorphic energy summary card showing:

- Electricity and Gas daily spend (from Bright / Hildebrand Glow integration).
- A horizontal-pill layout with animated pulses (blue for electricity, orange for gas).
- A smooth 24-hour mini-graph of cost trends (using `mini-graph-card`).
- Beautiful gradient background, rounded edges, and subtle drop-shadows.

---

**Required custom cards / plugins**

Install via HACS:

- `custom:stack-in-card`
- `custom:button-card`
- `custom:mini-graph-card`
- `card-mod`

---

**Required entities**

Electricity + gas cost sensors:
- `sensor.electricity` — *Displays the current electricity cost*  
- `sensor.gas` — *Displays the current gas cost*  
- `sensor.electricity_cost_today` — *Used for the 24h electricity graph*  
- `sensor.gas_cost_today` — *Used for the 24h gas graph*

> These typically come from the **Bright / Hildebrand Glow DCC** integration. Will require installing Bright app on your phone, creating a Glowmarkt account through the app, linking the smart meter in the house to Bright app, installing Hildebrand integration on HA with Glowmarkt username and password (works with many UK energy providers).

---

**Visual behaviour**

- The two pill-style header buttons show:
  - ⚡ Electricity price with blue theme
  - 🔥 Gas price with orange theme
- The bottom section displays a **mini-graph-card** line chart only when cost sensors are not `unknown`.
- Includes delayed animation for the graph path (smooth, glowing line).

---

**How to adapt for your setup**

- Replace the following entities with yours if named differently:
  - `sensor.electricity`
  - `sensor.gas`
  - `sensor.electricity_cost_today`
  - `sensor.gas_cost_today`
- Change colors by adjusting:
  - `#47C1E8` for electricity  
  - `#ffaa00` for gas
- You can remove the pulse animations if not needed by deleting the `@keyframes` blocks.
- Background gradient can be customised in:
  ```yaml
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(151, 87, 167, 0.25), rgba(75, 124, 132, 0.25));

<h1 style="color:#8AB4F8; font-weight:700;">MEDIA CENTRE CARD</h1>

<img width="562" height="285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a31254cf-d2b3-4913-9197-4897d4ca8374" />

**Purpose**

A full-featured **Media Centre** for an Alexa-based home, combining:

- A dynamic **"Now Playing" header** that follows the active Echo (`sensor.active_echo_player`) and shows a `bubble-card` media player.
- Three round glassmorphic action buttons:
  - 📢 **Announcements** – type or dictate a message, select rooms, and broadcast via Alexa.
  - 🎵 **Music Request** – request music by text/voice, pick target Echo or group, and start playback.
  - 📞 **Drop-In Intercom** – start Alexa Drop-In calls between rooms using source/target selects.
  - ⏰ **Alarms / Timers / Reminders** – create Alexa alarms, timers, and reminders from one UI.
- A scrolling **“Top News + Upcoming reminders/alarms/timers”** ticker driven by helper sensors.
- A full list of all Echo devices and TVs as `bubble-card` media players.

---

**Required custom cards / plugins**

Install via HACS (or manually):

**6. News + Upcoming alarms/timers/reminders ticker**

Entities:

- `event.top_stories_google_news` – used for headline + link.
- A 5-second ticking helper:
  - `input_boolean.5_second_timer` – used just to re-render and keep the scrolling content fresh.
- Per-echo “next event” sensors:
  - For each Echo (hallway, kitchen, lounge, master_bedroom, upstairs, room_2, room_3, room_4, study):
    - `sensor.<echo>_echo_next_reminder`
    - `sensor.<echo>_echo_next_alarm`
    - `sensor.<echo>_echo_next_timer`

Behaviour:

- Builds a JS array of upcoming events across all devices.
- Calculates time remaining in minutes / hours or shows date/time if > 24 hours away.
- Displays a vertically scrolling list:
  - Top: **Top News** headline (if available).
  - Then: **“Upcoming”** with all timers/alarms/reminders.
- You can tap the ticker to open the top news article link.

> Note: The card has two versions of this ticker – one when `sensor.active_echo_player != none` (shorter height) and one when it is `none` (taller height).

---

**Styling / Design**

- Entire card sits in a glassmorphic container with:
  - Gradient background (`red → blue` tone).
  - Blur, borders, and soft shadows.
- All main controls use rounded, glowing buttons and subtle tap animations (`tapPulse`, `pressEffect`).
- Designed for Storage Mode: **all logic is inline**, no YAML includes or Jinja templates.

---

**How to adapt for your setup**

- Replace all `media_player.*_echo` and TV entities with your own device names.
- Adjust helper entity IDs (`input_text.*`, `input_boolean.*`, `input_select.*`, `input_number.*`) to match your defined helpers, or create new helpers with these names.
- Hook the scripts (`script.make_an_announcement`, `script.play_requested_music`, `script.transfer_music_to_echo`, `script.initiate_intercom`, `script.set_alexa_alarm`, `script.set_alexa_timer`, `script.set_alexa_reminder`) to your Alexa integration (e.g. using `media_player.play_media` with `media_content_type: custom` commands).
- If you don’t use Google News, remove or replace `event.top_stories_google_news` and the `tap_action: url`.

---

**Prerequisites**

- A working **Alexa Media** or similar integration that exposes Echo devices as `media_player.*`.
- **browser_mod** configured in Home Assistant.
- Helper entities and scripts set up to match the ones listed above.

<h1 style="color:#8AB4F8; font-weight:700;">LOCATION, TRAVEL PROGRESS & SECURITY CARD</h1>

<img width="562" height="221" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c03e8f50-c6b2-40b8-9ca2-601fb19044f3" />


This file defines a glassmorphic **Location & Security strip** that shows:

- Two animated **presence / travel cards**:
  - **Person 1** – travel progress *or* phone battery, ETA, and current place
  - **Person 2** – travel progress *or* phone battery, ETA, and current place
- A compact **Home Security** alarm control panel
- A **Front Door Lock** status/quick-control button

The visual style matches the rest of the dashboard:

- Soft, blurred, glassmorphic background
- Gradient progress bars filling from left to right
- Circular avatar badges with profile photos or silhouettes
- Scrolling subtitle line for ETA / location
- Smooth transitions for progress changes

---

### Behaviour & Logic

#### Progress vs Battery logic

Each person card computes a `progress` variable that controls the gradient fill:

- When **away from home** (or just left):
  - Uses `sensor.home_travel_progress_person_1` / `sensor.home_travel_progress_person_2`
    (0–100%) as the fill amount.
  - The subtitle line shows:  
    `Reaching home in <ETA>` when `input_text.person_1_eta` / `input_text.person_2_eta` is valid.
- When **at home for more than ~2 minutes**:
  - Falls back to **phone battery level (%)** as the fill:
    - `sensor.person_1_phone_battery_level`
    - `sensor.person_2_phone_battery_level`
  - The name line shows a battery icon, for example:  
    `Person 1 ⚡️ 78%`.

There is a short grace period after arriving (travel progress 100% for <2 mins) so the bar can finish animating before switching to battery.

#### Subtitle text

- **Away with ETA available**  
  `Reaching home in <ETA>`
- **Otherwise**  
  `<PlaceLabel> • <last updated X mins/hours ago>`

Where:

- `PlaceLabel` is:
  - `"Home"` when state is `home`
  - `"Work"` when state is `Work`
  - `"Away"` for `not_home/unknown/away`
  - Or a matching `zone.*` friendly name
  - Or a cleaned-up version of the raw state.

The subtitle line scrolls horizontally (`scroll-left` keyframe) inside a masked area.

#### Security & Lock

- **Home Security** uses `mushroom-alarm-control-panel-card` for quick arming:
  - `armed_home`
  - `armed_away`
- **Front Door Lock** uses `mushroom-lock-card` with a minimal, background-less style so it blends into the glassmorphic container.

---

### Required Entities

<h1 style="color:#8AB4F8; font-weight:700;">SURVEILLANCE CARD</h1>

This card defines a glassmorphic **surveillance overview panel** that shows:

- A header row with:
  - **“Surveillance”** label
  - Animated **Active Stream status text**: `Cameras Actively Streaming`
  - A round **arm/disarm button** that blinks red when active
- A main camera row:
  - **Entry camera snapshot** (left)
  - **Outdoor live stream** (right)
- A 4-tile grid of **indoor cameras** that:
  - Show **snapshots** when idle
  - Show live feed on tap when surveillance is armed

All entity IDs below are **anonymised** for safety of publishing. Replace them with your own entities when adapting this card.

---

### Required Entities

#### Surveillance Control

- **Trigger / Arm Boolean**
  - `input_boolean.surveillance_trigger`

<h1 style="color:#8AB4F8; font-weight:700;">HOUSEKEEPERS CARD</h1>

<img width="570" height="249" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76938e90-b917-4cd2-9823-b526d186bde6" />

This card defines a glassmorphic **“House Keepers”** panel for three robots (e.g. lawn mower + two vacuums). It shows:

- A **title row**:
  - “House Keepers” label
  - A **scrolling status line** driven by a sensor (e.g. next runs, battery, areas)
  - Subtle title animation when any robot has left the dock or is returning
- A **three-column robot row**:
  - Large robot artwork (one per robot)
  - Under each image: a trio of **round controls**:
    - **Play** (start / resume)
    - **Pause** (pause / play-pause icon)
    - **Home** (send back to dock / returning state)

Each robot uses an `active`, `paused`, and `returning` boolean to control both UI animation and whatever automations you wire up behind them.

All entity IDs below are **anonymised** and safe to publish. Replace them with your own helpers/scripts in your setup.

---

### Required Entities

#### Shared Status / Header

- **Status sensor**
  - `sensor.housekeepers_status`  
    Used for the scrolling status line (e.g. “Lawn mower due at 10:30 • Upstairs vac cleaning bedrooms…”).

- **Activity flags**

  - `input_boolean.hk2_active`
  - `input_boolean.hk3_active`
  - `input_boolean.hk1_returning`
  - `input_boolean.hk2_returning`
  - `input_boolean.hk3_returning`

The header animation checks whether **any** robot is active or returning and slides the title + status line accordingly.

---

### Housekeeper 1 (e.g. Lawn Mower)

- **Booleans**
  - `input_boolean.hk1_active` – robot is running / away from dock
  - `input_boolean.hk1_paused` – paused vs playing (for icon swap)
  - `input_boolean.hk1_returning` – returning to dock

- **Behaviour**
  - **Play button** → `input_boolean.hk1_active` turned on
  - **Pause button** → toggles `input_boolean.hk1_paused`
  - **Home button** → turns on `input_boolean.hk1_returning`

- **Extras**
  - **App launch** (optional, via Fully Kiosk):  
    `fully.startApplication('com.eco.global.app')`

---

### Housekeeper 2 (e.g. Downstairs Vacuum)

- **Behaviour**
  - **Play button** → turns on `input_boolean.hk2_active`
  - **Pause button** → toggles `input_boolean.hk2_paused`
  - **Home button** → calls `script.hk2_stop_and_reset_ui`

- **Extras**
  - App launch example: `fully.startApplication('com.eufylife.smarthome')`

---

### Housekeeper 3 (e.g. Upstairs Vacuum)

- **Booleans**
  - `input_boolean.hk3_active`
  - `input_boolean.hk3_paused`
  - `input_boolean.hk3_returning`

- **Behaviour**
  - **Play button** → turns on `input_boolean.hk3_active`
  - **Pause button** → toggles `input_boolean.hk3_paused`
  - **Home button** → turns on `input_boolean.hk3_returning`

- **Extras**
  - App launch example: `fully.startApplication('com.dreame.smartlife')`

---

### Dependencies

You’ll need:

- **Custom cards**
  - [`custom:mod-card`](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)
  - [`custom:button-card`](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)

<h1 style="color:#8AB4F8; font-weight:700;">QUICKFIRE CARD</h1>

<img width="570" height="146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f1a2e80-7060-4c73-9ee9-9d9b996aea6a" />

The **Quickfire** card is a glassmorphic control panel that gives you **fast access** to three common “whole-house” actions:

- **Lights** – snapshot and control all active lights with a smart “restore / replace” flow.
- **Heat** – adjust multiple thermostats (downstairs, upstairs, whole house) from one popup.
- **Blinds** – send **open / stop / my / close** to all blinds at once.
- **Automate** – view system “telemetry” and safely **disable / restore automations** using a PIN-protected keypad.

The card is designed to sit as a **single row** with four large buttons, each opening a full-screen glassy popup.

---

## Dependencies

### Custom Cards / Integrations

You’ll need:

- [`custom:mod-card`](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)
- [`custom:button-card`](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)
- [`browser_mod`](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod)

Optional core cards used inside popups (bundled with Home Assistant):

- `grid`, `vertical-stack`
- `markdown`
- `thermostat`

Make sure all custom cards + browser_mod are installed (e.g. via HACS) and added in **Settings → Dashboards → Resources**.

---

## High-Level Layout

Quickfire (mod-card)
├─ Title: “Quickfire”
└─ 4-column grid:
   ├─ Lights   → full-screen popup (smart “all lights” control)
   ├─ Heat     → full-screen popup (3 thermostats)
   ├─ Blinds   → full-screen popup (all blinds open/stop/my/close)
   └─ Automate → full-screen popup (telemetry + automation kill/restore with PIN)

The **outer `mod-card`** provides the frosted glass background, rounded corners, and drop shadow.  
Inside it, a **`vertical-stack`** contains:

1. A centered **“Quickfire”** heading.  
2. A **4-column `grid`** – one button per feature.

---

Button 1 – Lights
-----------------

<img width="547" height="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00b428bd-f02a-44b4-a290-cedee47b4392" />

### Purpose

- Shows a count of **currently-on lights** (`sensor.on_lights_count`).
- On tap, opens a popup that:
  - Detects if there’s a **saved snapshot** of lights (`sensor.lights_snapshot_storage`).
  - Asks different questions depending on:
    - Are some lights currently on?
    - Is there a stored snapshot?
  - Calls a **single script** with different `command` variables:
    - `save_and_off` – save the current on-lights to snapshot and turn them off.
    - `restore_and_clear` – restore previous lights from snapshot and clear it.
    - `override_and_off` – turn off current lights and replace snapshot.

### Required Entities / Scripts

- `sensor.on_lights_count` – number of lights currently on.
- `sensor.lights_snapshot_storage` – stores CSV list of entity IDs for snapshot.
- `script.smart_lights_control` – main controller script that accepts a `command` variable:
  - `save_and_off`
  - `restore_and_clear`
  - `override_and_off`

### Popup Behaviour

The popup is built with `browser_mod.popup` and nested `mod-card` layers to:

- Make the popup **full screen** and edge-to-edge.
- Show a **title animation** (“Control All Lights”).
- Show conditional Markdown text:
  - All off & no snapshot → “All lights are already off…”
  - No snapshot & some on → “Turn off all current lights?”
  - Snapshot & none on → “Restore your previous lights?”
  - Snapshot & some on → “What would you like to do?” (Restore vs Turn off & replace)
- Show **two main buttons**:
  - Green: “Yes / Restore / Close” (depending on context)
  - Red: “Cancel / Turn off & replace” (hidden entirely if not applicable)
- A final **“Close”** pill button to exit.

The main grid button also:

- Displays a **lightbulb image** (`/local/Quickfire/lighton.png` or `/local/Quickfire/lightoff.png`).
- Shows the **count badge** on top of the image when `on_lights_count > 0`.

---

Button 2 – Heat
---------------

<img width="1223" height="627" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c97c648-09fa-4d0d-a7b2-687ee8cd006b" />

### Purpose

- Shows a small thermostat icon and **house-average temperature** (`sensor.house_temperature_weighted`).
- On tap, opens a popup to control **3 thermostats**:
  - `climate.downstairs_heating` → “Downstairs”
  - `climate.upstairs_heating` → “Upstairs”
  - `climate.whole_house_heating` → “Whole House”

Each thermostat appears in a floating glass card with a subtle **fade/zoom/blur-in** animation.

### Required Entities

- `sensor.house_temperature_weighted`
- `climate.downstairs_heating`
- `climate.upstairs_heating`
- `climate.whole_house_heating`

Additional climate entities referenced in the icon logic (for “any heating on?” check):

- Downstairs:
  - `climate.hallway_thermostat`
  - `climate.lounge_thermostat`
  - `climate.kitchen_thermostat`
  - `climate.wc_thermostat`
- Upstairs:
  - `climate.ensuite_thermostat`
  - `climate.washroom_thermostat`
  - `climate.room_2_thermostat`
  - `climate.room_3_thermostat`
  - `climate.room_4_thermostat`
  - `climate.study_thermostat`

### Icon Behaviour

- If **any** of the above thermostats have state not equal to `off`, the button uses:
  - `/local/Quickfire/thermostaton.png`
- Otherwise:
  - `/local/Quickfire/thermostatoff.png`
- A badge shows the **weighted house temperature** to one decimal place (e.g. `21.3°`).

---

Button 3 – Blinds
-----------------

<img width="454" height="627" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fd4a847-5011-4a82-b559-99335e6e76a0" />

### Purpose

- Shows a blinds icon and the **last command** sent to the lounge blinds.
- On tap, opens a popup that sends **global commands** (`cover_entity: all`) to your `script.control_blinds`:
  - **Open** → `command: open`
  - **Stop** → `command: stop`
  - **My** → `command: my`
  - **Close** → `command: close`

Each control is a large, glowing circular button with subtle staggered animations.

### Required Entities / Scripts

- **Somfy control script**
  - `script.control_blinds`
    - Accepts at least:
      - `cover_entity` (here set to `all`)
      - `command` (`open`, `stop`, `my`, `close`)
      - `browser_id` (used to target the calling browser for UI feedback, optional depending on your implementation)
- **State helper (for the small icon badge):**
  - `input_select.lounge_blinds_last_command`  
    Possible values: `open`, `close`, `my`, `stop`.

### Icon Behaviour

- Shows `/local/Quickfire/blinds.png` as the base image.
- Displays a small circular badge with a **mdi icon** based on last command:

| Command | Badge Icon       |
|---------|------------------|
| open    | `mdi:arrow-up`   |
| close   | `mdi:arrow-down` |
| my      | `mdi:star`       |
| stop    | `mdi:pause`      |

---

Button 4 – Automate
-------------------

![Screenshot_20251208_225240_Fully Kiosk Browser](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e940338-1943-4e43-96f6-d6847308aeb7)

### Purpose

This is the **advanced** button – a full “system control” popup that:

1. Shows animated **terminal-style telemetry**:
   - Integrations/components
   - Recent automations & scripts
   - Randomised entity events
2. Lets you **kill all automations** OR **restore** them from a snapshot.
3. Protects the “kill” path with a **PIN keypad**.

### Required Entities / Scripts / Helpers

**Snapshot & counts**

- `sensor.automations_snapshot_storage` (and optional `_2`)
  - Attributes:
    - `entities` (comma-separated list of automations)
    - `count` / `bool_count` (numbers of things to restore)
- `sensor.enabled_automations_count` (and optional `_2`)

**Kill gate & PIN**

![Screenshot_20251208_225255_Fully Kiosk Browser](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cde2c373-9d2c-4766-a2a4-291361689f23)

- `input_boolean.automation_kill_gate` – controls whether the keypad is shown.
- `sensor.automation_kill_pin_dots` – displays `••••` style dots in the UI.
- `sensor.automation_kill_pin_status` – text feedback:
  - `Correct code` / `Incorrect code` etc.
- `input_text.automation_kill_pin_entered` – stores the digits as user types.

**PIN scripts**

- `script.append_digit_to_kill_pin` – add a digit `"0"–"9"`.
- `script.backspace_kill_pin` – delete last digit.
- `script.automations_toggle_banner` – main logic to:
  - Enable/disable automations.
  - Validate `code`.
  - Optionally skip PIN when `skip_pin: true`.
- Optional:
  - `sensor.enabled_automations_count_2`
  - `sensor.automations_snapshot_storage_2`

### Behaviour

- First prompt:
  - If **all automations are disabled** but there is a snapshot → primary button becomes **“Restore previous”**, calling `script.automations_toggle_banner` with `skip_pin: true`.
  - Otherwise, primary button opens the **kill gate**:
    - `input_boolean.automation_kill_gate` → `on`
- When kill gate is **on**:
  - Shows a **PIN keypad** (0–9, clear, backspace).
